# Revenue Collection and Management for Municipal Corporation of indore 

## Problem Statement:
  Develop a robust revenue management system for the municipal corporationâ€™s revenue department to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of revenue collection and management.

  Consider property tax, water tax, garbage collection tax etc. for tax calculation.

  The revenue department of municipal corporations plays a critical role in ensuring the financial health of urban areas by collecting taxes, fees, and other revenue sources. Inefficiencies in revenue collection, manual processing errors, and lack of transparency can lead to revenue losses.

    - Facilitates secure and easy tax payments directly through WhatsApp.
    - Sends reminders and notifications for upcoming payment deadlines, overdue taxes, and other important updates.
    - We create on Demand storage for Documents.
